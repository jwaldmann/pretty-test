\frametitle{What the Implementation Looks Like}

\begin{itemize}
\item it is really a first-order functional program
\item higher order functions for notational convenience only,

  the compiler inlines them (it should)
  
\item uses algebraic data types (trees) to represent
  documents
\item also uses numbers, e.g., to decide
  whether something fits on a line, or needs break
\end{itemize}
