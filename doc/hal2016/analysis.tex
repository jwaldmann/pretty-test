  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item analysis of programs on terms alone 

(shape of tree, ignoring contents of nodes) 

e.g., resource aware ML (RaML) by Martin Hofmann
\item (in general: can represent numbers as trees)
\item analysis of programs on numbers (only) 

  (approximate their relations by piecewise linear functions)
\item (in general: register machine is Turing-complete)

\item implementations, benchmarking,
