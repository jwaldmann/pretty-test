  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item 
    for any model of computation 

    (Program $P$, small-step semantics $\to_P$ on data (trees))
  \item
    \emph{derivation height} of $t\in \Term(\Sigma)$, 
w.r.t. Program $P$

    length of a longest derivation (computation) starting in $t$

    $\deha_P(t)=\sup\{ k\mid \exists t': t\to_P^k t' \}$
  \item 
    \emph{derivational complexity} of $R$:

    derivation height as function of input size

    $\dece_P= s \mapsto \sup \{\deha_P(t) \mid |t|\le s \}$.
  \item in general:
    
    complexity of a program $=$ (input size $\mapsto$ resource usage)

  \item we want statements like ``the complexity of that algorithm
    is linear'', \dots

  \item     (complexity of a problem:  

    best complexity of a program that solves the problem)

  \end{itemize}
