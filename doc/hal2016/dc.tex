  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item
    \emph{derivation height} of $t\in \Term(\Sigma)$, w.r.t. $R$

    length of a longest derivation (computation) starting in $t$

    $\deha_R(t)=\sup\{ k\mid \exists t': t\to_R^k t' \}$
  \item 
    \emph{derivational complexity} of $R$:

    derivation height as function of input size

    $\dece_R= s \mapsto \sup \{\deha_R(t) \mid |t|\le s \}$.
  \item in general:
    
    complexity of a program $=$ (input size $\mapsto$ resource usage)

  \item we want statements like ``the complexity of that algorithm
    is linear'', \dots

  \item     (complexity of a problem:  

    best complexity of a program that solves the problem)

  \end{itemize}
