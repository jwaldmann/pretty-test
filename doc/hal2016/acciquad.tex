\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item 
claim: 
in most practical cases, 
you want linear cost,
and anything above that is a \emph{bug}

\item
nice collection of such bugs:
\url{http://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/}
(Nelson Elhage)

from various libraries, languages, paradigms


\item
wanted:

methods, tools, IDE integration 

to prove and disprove \emph{linear} upper bounds
\item 
  as long as we don't have this 
  --- use systematic performance testing
